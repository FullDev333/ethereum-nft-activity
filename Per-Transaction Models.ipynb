    "# Computing Per-Transaction Responsibility for Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum miners use energy that causes emissions. The amount of emissions varies with respect to energy sources, and the about of energy varies mainly as a function of time with respect to GPU efficiency. To simplify this discussion, we will work with hashrate (hashes per second) and hashcount (hashes) instead of energy or emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is more meaningful to allocate hashcount responsibility across all miners, or all transactions, than across both simultaneously. Here we allocate based on transactions, because the goal is to create accountability at the point of use.\n",
    "* The hashrate does not vary directly based on the properties of the transactions. This means allocating a hashcount to each transaction is a philosophical question rather than a technical question.\n",
    "* The sum of allocated usage should add up to the total usage. This means the sum of transaction hashcounts should add up to the total Ethereum hashcount. Or that the sum of all allocated emissions should add up to the total emissions.\n",
    "* Transactions contribute to the hashrate in proportion to how much the transaction incentivizes miners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Miners are incentivized by payments in Ethereum, and by speculation about the future value of Ethereum. Miners are paid in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Varying transaction fees paid by users when making a transaction, recently around 2ETH total.\n",
    "2. A fixed per-block reward at 2ETH (which was previously 3ETH and 5ETH), with additional nuances for uncle blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few big questions to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Should responsibility be allocated based on first order effects (like payment of transaction fees) or second order effects (like increasing the hashrate)? If the hashrate of Ethereum was fixed, how could we allocate responsibility?\n",
    "- Should responsibility be assigned as a portion of a block's energy usage (assuming each block is the same throughout a day), a portion of one day, or as a portion of a longer timeline like the entire history of Ethereum? Should a transaction years ago also be considered partially responsible for energy usage today?\n",
    "- Should the block rewards be ignored, or should they factor in to the model evenly across all transactions, based on gas usage, or something else?\n",
    "- When comparing over longer timelines, how can we account for the fact that a higher price for Ethereum provides a higher incentive to miners?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following models explore the effects of different answers to these questions."
